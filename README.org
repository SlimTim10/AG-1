* AG-1

** Description

[[file:documents/image-002.jpg]]

The AG-1 is a data logger that captures acceleration and gyroscope measurements. The data is written onto a microSD card as CSV files (Comma Separated Values files). It uses a 2 GB microSD card and writes one file for both acceleration measurements and gyroscope measurements. Data is read by
ejecting the microSD card and reading the data using a separate microSD card reader. Power is supplied through the use of a rechargeable lithium-polymer battery which can be recharged using a Micro-USB port.
